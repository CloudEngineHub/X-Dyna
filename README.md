## **Abstract**
We introduce X-Dyna, a novel zero-shot, diffusion-based pipeline for animating a single human image using facial expressions and body movements derived from a driving video, that generates realistic, context-aware dynamics for both the subject and the surrounding environment. Building on prior approaches centered on human pose control, X-Dyna addresses key factors underlying the loss of dynamic details, enhancing the lifelike qualities of human video animations. At the core of our approach is the Dynamics-Adapter, a lightweight module that effectively integrates reference appearance context into the spatial attentions of the diffusion backbone while preserving the capacity of motion modules in synthesizing fluid and intricate dynamic details. Beyond body pose control, we connect a local control module with our model to capture identity-disentangled facial expressions, facilitating accurate expression transfer for enhanced realism in animated scenes. Together, these components form a unified framework capable of learning physical human motion and natural scene dynamics from a diverse blend of human and scene videos. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X-Dyna outperforms state-of-the-art methods, creating highly lifelike and expressive animations.

## **Architecture**

We leverage a pretrained diffusion UNet backbone for controlled human image animation, enabling expressive dynamic details and precise motion control. Specifically, we introduce a dynamics adapter that seamlessly integrates the reference image context as a trainable residual to the spatial attention, in parallel with the denoising process, while preserving the original spatial and temporal attention mechanisms within the UNet. In addition to body pose control via a ControlNet, we introduce a local face control module that implicitly learns facial expression control from a synthesized cross-identity face patch. We train our model on a diverse dataset of human motion videos and natural scene videos simultaneously.

## **Dynamics Adapter**
### **Archtecture Designs for Human Video Animation**
a) IP-Adapter encodes the reference image as an image CLIP embedding and injects the information into the cross-attention layers in SD as the residual. b) ReferenceNet is a trainable parallel UNet and feeds the semantic information into SD via concatenation of self-attention features. c) Dynamics-Adapter encodes the reference image with a partially shared-weight UNet. The appearance control is realized by learning a residual in the self-attention with trainable query and output linear layers. All other components share the same frozen weight with SD.

## üìà Results
### Comparison
To evaluate the dynamics texture generation performance of X-Dyna in human video animation, we compare the generation results of X-Dyna with MagicPose (ReferenceNet-based method) and MimicMotion (SVD-based method). For a fair comparison, all generated videos share the same resolution of Height x Width = 896 x 512.

## üìú Requirements
* An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is required. 
  * We have tested on a single A100 GPU.
  * In our experiment, we used CUDA 11.8.
  * **Minimum**: The minimum GPU memory required is 20GB for generating a single video (batch_size=1) of 16 frames.
  * **Recommended**: We recommend using a GPU with 80GB of memory.
* Operating system: Linux Debian 11 (bullseye)

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies and Installation

Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Boese0601/X-Dyna
cd X-Dyna
```

### Installation Guide

We provide an `requirements.txt` file for setting up the environment.

Run the following command on your terminal:
```shell
# 1. Prepare conda environment
conda create -n xdyna python==3.10 

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate xdyna

# 3. Install dependencies
bash env_torch2_install.sh

# I know it's a bit weird that pytorch is installed with different versions twice in that bash file, but I don't know why it doesn't work if I directly installed the final one (torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchaudio==2.0.2+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118). 
# If you managed to fix this, please open an issue and let me know, thanks. :DDDDD   
# o_O I hate environment and dependencies errors. 
```

## üß± Download Pretrained Models
Due to restrictions, we are not able to release the model pre-trained with in-house data. Instead, we re-train our model on public datasets, e.g. [HumanVid](https://github.com/zhenzhiwang/HumanVid), and other human video data for research use, e.g. [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

We follow the implementation details in our paper and release pretrained weights and other network modules in [this huggingface repository](https://huggingface.co/Boese0601/X-Dyna). After downloading, please put all of them under the [pretrained_weights](pretrained_weights/) folder. 

The Stable Diffusion 1.5 UNet can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5) and place it under [pretrained_weights/initialization/unet_initialization/SD](pretrained_weights/initialization/unet_initialization/SD). 

Your file structure should look like this:

```bash
X-Dyna
|----...
|----pretrained_weights
  |----controlnet
    |----controlnet-checkpoint-epoch-5.ckpt
  |----controlnet_face
    |----controlnet-face-checkpoint-epoch-2.ckpt

    |----unet-checkpoint-epoch-5.ckpt
  
  |----initialization
    |----controlnets_initialization
      |----controlnet
